As seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/hOnyaZyPKCs)

These are sized for toothpicks that are 2mm in diameter and 64.5mm long.

`face.stl` will complain about non-manifold but it printed fine for me, but I think used a brim for adhesion as it starts fairly narrow.

`vertex-3-gluing.stl` and `vertex-5-gluing.stl` are unfortunately taken straight from an in situ model so they don't lay flat. Use your slicer or other tool to lay it flat (Cura has a great "select a face to align to build plate"). These are sized so that when looking straight down on them, the tip of the toothpick lines up with the edge of the triangle/pentagon.

I ended up not using `vertex-5-gluing.stl` as its too small to be that useful.
