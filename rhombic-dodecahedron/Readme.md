These are sized for toothpicks that are 2mm in diameter and 64.5mm long.

I printed `gluing-jig.stl` vertically with support material only touching the buildplate and it works fine.

`support-gluing-jig.stl` has one bit that is mitered as I originally intended to connect two halves to form the dihedral angle as in `gluing-jig.stl`, but it needs to be mirrored and it ended up working fine just as a single face as the dihedral angle is already established by the first jig.
